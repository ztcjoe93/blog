+++

So generally, when someone decides on a tool to use for, let's just say generic operations, they usually use shell scripts.
And the thing about shell scripts is that there's so many flavors to it -- it could be Bash, zsh; there's so many options out there.  

So when I was at work, I saw this `Makefile` in the repository and it was kind of different :raised_eyebrow: -- instead of like a whole bunch of compilation commands for your typical C++ program, it was actually a file used to run specific commands, and in this case to actually manage certain resources in a Kubernetes cluster.  

So I went to experiment with a whole bunch of stuff and modifying the existing file and my surprise is actually kind of useful I guess? One particular disclaimer is that I've never written any build Makefile for any program at all -- so this was a pretty fresh perspective for a "pseudo shell script".  


This is how the Makefile ended up looking like:  

```makefile
NAMESPACE    = kubernetes-namespace
ENV          = dev
VERSION      = 1.0.0

define TITLE

         ███╗   ███╗ █████╗ ██╗  ██╗███████╗███████╗██╗██╗     ███████╗

export TITLE

check: ## pre-requisite check to ensure that variables are provided
	@echo "\n▶ Checking existing variables...\n"
	@if [[ "$(NAMESPACE)" == "" ]]; then echo "NAMESPACE not set!" && exit 1; fi
	@if [[ "$(ENV)" == "" ]]; then echo "ENVIRONMENT not set!" && exit 1; fi
	@if [[ "$(VERSION)" == "" ]]; then echo "VERSION not set!" && exit 1; fi
	@echo "All required variables configured!\n"

env: ## show environment variables configured
	@make check
	@echo "\n▶ Current variables\n"
	@echo "NAMESPACE\t\t=" $(NAMESPACE)
	@echo "ENV\t\t\t=" $(ENV)
	@echo "VERSION\t\t\t= $(VERSION)\n"

help:
	@echo "$$TITLE"
	@grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sort | awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "\033[36m%-30s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}'
	@echo ""

.PHONY: env
.DEFAULT_GOAL := help
```

A quick breakdown of certain key points:  

`@`: To execute the command without echoing it out to the shell.  
`define + endef`: A variable that is set to a list of commands.  
`.PHONY`: To explicitly state that a specific target isn't a file.  
`$$`: Escaping dollar sign to reference to the Makefile variable

Here's a quick demo of how it looks like:  
```shell
ztchua@Mac dev % make

env                            show environment variables configured

ztchua@Mac dev % make env

▶ Checking existing variables...

All required variables configured!


▶ Current variables

NAMESPACE               = kubernetes-namespace
ENV                     = dev
VERSION                 = 1.0.0

ztchua@Mac dev %
```

It is pretty interesting how we can tweak a `Makefile` to act as a pseudo shell script, and the catch here is that _it may actually be faster to configure_ when compared to a traditional shell script.  

But whether it's really practical anot, I'd leave that up to you :grinning:
